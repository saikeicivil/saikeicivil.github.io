  <h2 class="section-title">What is Saikei Civil?</h2>
  
  <p>
    Saikei Civil is the world's first open-source <strong>native IFC authoring tool</strong> 
    for horizontal infrastructure. While tools like Bonsai excel at vertical construction 
    (buildings), Saikei shapes the world around them — roads, alignments, corridors, 
    and earthwork.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Built as a Blender extension, Saikei Civil creates <strong>IFC 4.3</strong> files as 
    its native format — not as an export target. This "native IFC" philosophy means 
    your infrastructure designs are truly interoperable from the start.

  <h2 class="section-title">Why Open Source?</h2>
  
  <p>
    Professional civil engineering software costs thousands of dollars annually, 
    putting it out of reach for small firms, students, and engineers in developing countries. 
    Saikei Civil aims to democratize these tools while advancing open standards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By building on <strong>IFC 4.3</strong> — the international standard for infrastructure BIM — 
    we're creating tools that work with any compliant software, not against it.

  <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
  
  <p>
    Saikei Civil is developed by <strong>Michael Yoder</strong> at 
    <strong>Desert Springs Civil Engineering PLLC</strong> in Nampa, Idaho.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The name "Saikei" (栽景) refers to the Japanese art of creating miniature planted landscapes — 
    the perfect complement to Bonsai's focus on individual trees. Together, they represent 
    a complete vision for open-source BIM.
