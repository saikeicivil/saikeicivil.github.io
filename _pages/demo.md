Saikei Civil provides production-ready infrastructure design capabilities built on IFC 4.3 and Blender.

---

## Horizontal Alignments

Design road centerlines using industry-standard PI (Point of Intersection) methodology.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **PI-Based Design** | Define alignments through control points with automatic tangent generation |
| **Curve Geometry** | Circular curves with configurable radii |
| **Station Equations** | Full stationing support with equation handling |
| **Real-Time Preview** | Immediate visualization as parameters change |

---

## Vertical Profiles

Create vertical alignments with grade-compliant vertical curves.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **PVI-Based Design** | Vertical curves defined through Points of Vertical Intersection |
| **Parabolic Curves** | AASHTO-compliant symmetric and asymmetric curves |
| **Grade Calculations** | Automatic grade percentage computation |
| **K-Value Support** | Design speed verification through rate of curvature |

---

## Cross-Section Templates

Define roadway typical sections with parametric components.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AASHTO Templates** | Pre-configured lane and shoulder widths |
| **Parametric Lanes** | Adjustable travel lanes with crown slopes |
| **Shoulders** | Inside and outside shoulders with independent slopes |
| **Side Slopes** | Cut and fill slope definitions |

---

## Georeferencing

Accurate real-world positioning through coordinate reference systems.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **CRS Integration** | PyProj-powered coordinate system support |
| **EPSG Codes** | Standard coordinate reference system identifiers |
| **Sub-Millimeter Precision** | Validated accuracy for survey-grade positioning |
| **Coordinate Transforms** | Project-to-global and global-to-project conversions |

---

## Native IFC 4.3 Export

Direct authoring to the international infrastructure BIM standard.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **IfcAlignment** | Full horizontal and vertical alignment export |
| **IfcAlignmentHorizontal** | Tangent and curve segment definitions |
| **IfcAlignmentVertical** | Grade and parabolic curve segments |
| **Georeferenced Output** | IFC files include coordinate reference system data |

## Demonstration Project

### Lucky Peak Dam Access Road — Boise, Idaho

A demonstration project showcasing Saikei Civil's alignment and cross-section capabilities for rural road infrastructure.

**Scope:**
- 2.3 km horizontal alignment with compound curves
- Vertical profile with 4% maximum grade
- Rural road cross-section (24' travel way, 4' shoulders)
- IFC 4.3 export with Idaho State Plane coordinates

**Documentation:** In progress
