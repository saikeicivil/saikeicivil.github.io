Saikei Civil is developed full-time by Michael Yoder, PE, as the primary project of Desert Springs Civil Engineering PLLC. Your support directly funds continued development of open-source infrastructure design tools.

---

## Why Support Matters

Unlike most open-source projects maintained as side projects, Saikei Civil receives full-time professional engineering attention. This means:

- **Faster development cycles** — dedicated focus on the roadmap
- **Professional-grade code** — engineering rigor applied to every feature
- **Responsive maintenance** — bugs and issues addressed promptly
- **Long-term stability** — sustainable development, not sporadic updates

Funding ensures this work continues and accelerates the path to production-ready infrastructure design tools accessible to everyone.
