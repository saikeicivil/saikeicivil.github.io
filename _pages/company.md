## Philosophy

**Engineers building tools for engineers.**

Most civil engineering software is built by software companies, then sold to engineers. We're doing it the other way around.

Desert Springs Civil brings real project experience to every line of code. When Saikei Civil calculates a vertical curve or exports an IfcAlignment, it's built by someone who's staked alignments in the field.

**Open standards benefit everyone.**

 Open standards—like IFC 4.3—let designs travel between applications and remain accessible across decades-long asset lifecycles.
