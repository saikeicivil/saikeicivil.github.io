# LinkedIn Announcement Drafts

These are draft posts for announcing Saikei Civil. Edit as needed.

## Option A: Standards-Focused (for buildingSMART audience)

**What if infrastructure designs were IFC from day one—not converted after the fact?**

That's the question driving Saikei Civil, an open-source native IFC 4.3 authoring tool for roads, alignments, and civil infrastructure.

Most BIM workflows look like this:
.dwg → .ifc (export)
.rvt → .ifc (export)

Data degrades at each conversion. The IFC file becomes an afterthought.

Saikei Civil works differently:
.ifc = Source of Truth

Built on Blender and IfcOpenShell, it creates:
• IfcAlignment with horizontal and vertical components
• IfcMapConversion for georeferencing
• IfcProjectedCRS for coordinate system definitions

30,000+ lines of production code. 107+ tests passing. GPL v3 licensed.

Whether you're coordinating a complex project team across multiple platforms or delivering to clients with varying BIM requirements—designs that start as IFC stay interoperable throughout the asset lifecycle.

## Option B: Practitioner-Focused

**An open-source alternative is emerging for infrastructure design.**

Saikei Civil is a Blender extension for roads, alignments, and corridor modeling—built natively on IFC 4.3.

Current capabilities:
✓ Horizontal alignments (PI-based design)
✓ Vertical profiles (PVI-based with parabolic curves)
✓ Cross-sections (AASHTO-compliant templates)
✓ Georeferencing (PyProj, EPSG codes)
✓ Native IFC 4.3 export

In development:
→ 3D corridor mesh generation

Built by Michael Yoder, PE (14 years civil engineering experience, Bureau of Reclamation, HDR) through Desert Springs Civil Engineering PLLC.

Part of the OSArch ecosystem alongside Bonsai (buildings) and IfcOpenShell.

Free. Open source. Designed for interoperability.

## Option C: Short Teaser

**Native IFC for infrastructure is here.**

Saikei Civil: open-source alignment, profile, and corridor design built on IFC 4.3.

Not a converter. Not an exporter. Native IFC authoring.

30,000+ lines of code. 100% test pass rate. GPL v3.
